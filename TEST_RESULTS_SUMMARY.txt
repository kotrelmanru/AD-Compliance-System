                          SUMMARY STATISTICS
================================================================================

FAA AD 2025-23-53 (DC-10/MD-10/MD-11 Aircraft):
  ✅ Affected:           3 aircraft (30%)
  ⚪ Not Applicable:     7 aircraft (70%)
  
  Affected Models: MD-11, DC-10-30F, MD-10-10F

EASA AD 2025-0254 (A320/A321 Structural Inspections):
  ✅ Affected:           2 aircraft (20%)
  ❌ Excluded:           3 aircraft (30%) - have production mods/SBs
  ⚪ Not Applicable:     5 aircraft (50%)
  
  Affected Models: A320-214 #5234, A321-111 #8123
  Excluded Models: A320-232 (mod 24591), A320-214 #7456 (SB), A321-112 (mod 24977)

================================================================================
                              KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. FAA AD has broad applicability - affects entire DC-10/MD-10/MD-11 families
   with no MSN or modification exclusions.

2. EASA AD has targeted applicability - affects A320/A321 families but excludes
   aircraft with specific production modifications or service bulletins that
   already address the structural issue.

3. Three-state logic is essential:
   - "YES" = Must comply
   - "NO" = Model matches but excluded (already has fix)
   - "NOT APPLICABLE" = Model outside AD scope

4. Modification tracking is critical - 30% of Airbus aircraft are excluded
   from EASA AD due to existing modifications.

================================================================================

Legend:
  ✅ YES = Aircraft affected by AD (must comply)
  ❌ NO = Aircraft excluded by modifications (already has fix)
  ⚪ NOT APPLICABLE = Aircraft model not in AD scope
